# OpenGenCode
A comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate research in secure code generation, and vulnerability detection and analysis. It consists of 9,000 AI-generated Python programs, created using six different open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) performing a wide range of computing tasks. The dataset is labeled through static analysis.
